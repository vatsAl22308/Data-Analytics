**Objective**

This project aims to predict customer churn in the banking sector using historical data and derived features. The goal is to understand the key factors that influence customer retention and to help banks make informed decisions to reduce customer attrition.

Retaining customers is more cost-effective than acquiring new ones. Therefore, this predictive model can aid in identifying high-risk customers and enable proactive measures to improve their satisfaction and loyalty.

**Dataset Description**


The dataset consists of both raw and engineered features, capturing various aspects of customer behavior, such as:

Demographic Variables: Age, Gender, Salary, Working Status

Credit and Financial Indicators: Credit Score, Balance, Loan History

Engagement Metrics: Number of Products, Frequency of Transactions, Tenure, Complaints, and Customer Service Logs

Target Variable: Churn (1 = Exited, 0 = Retained)

The data was collected from multiple sources:

Internal banking systems (Online banking, Credit card dept.)

Customer surveys and call center logs

Market intelligence reports

**Tools an technique** 

Languages & Libraries

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Techniques Applied

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): To understand the data distribution, identify trends, and detect outliers

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, outlier treatment using Clamping (e.g., for age and credit score)

Feature Engineering: Creating relevant features like Avg_Transaction_Monthly, categorizing credit scores, and summarizing complaints

Model Building: Regression and Classification techniques to predict churn

Model Evaluation: Correlation analysis, and comparison of churn rates across demographic groups

**Descriptive analysis**
